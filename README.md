# Simple-JS-exercies

I have developed a some simple algorithmic exercises regarding the following:

### Calculator:

add, subtract, get the sum, multiply, get the power, and find the factorial

### Palindromes:

A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same both forwards and backwards, usually without considering punctuation or word breaks

### SnakeCase:

practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are separated with one underscore character (_) and no spaces, with each element's initial letter usually lowercased 

### Caesar Cipher:

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.


### Fibonacci series:

a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 

The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

### PigLatin
is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing. It obeys a few simple rules (below) but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand [(wiki link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin) .

    -Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
    
    -Rule 2: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
